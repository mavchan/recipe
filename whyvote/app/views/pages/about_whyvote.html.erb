    <b>whyVOTE</b> is a social media platform for politics, providing young Canadians everything they need to know about an upcoming election and allowing them to compare views with friends. </br> Based out of the University of Waterloo, we are a startup piloting for the 2015 Federal Election (October 19, 2015). The current beta version of our platform is accessible to any student enrolled at the University of Waterloo.</br> In addition to providing young Canadians a central platform for elections information, whyVOTE also collects data on the youth opinion to provide to policy-influencers. </br></br></br>
    <b>Survey Creation Methodology:</b></br>In June 2015, we polled a sample of over 200 University of Waterloo students to determine policy topics of most interest to students.</br>These include (in order of popularity):
    <ol>
      <li>Electoral reform</li>
      <li>Combatting climate change</li>
      <li>Combatting terrorist threads</li>
      <li>Military spending</li>
      <li>Employment and skills training</li>
      <li>Post-secondary issues</li>
      <li>Economic stimulus</li>
      <li>Tax policy</li>
      <li>International trade</li>
    </ol>
    </br>We created the survey based on these 9 topics. Research was done by the whyVOTE team utilizing various media and government sources.</br></br><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> </br>Although we try our best to be non-partisan and as accurate as possible with our information, we do not guarantee all policies and issues are presented 100% accurately.</br>Thus, please do not hesitate to contact us if you see any errors or mistakes in our work.</br>
