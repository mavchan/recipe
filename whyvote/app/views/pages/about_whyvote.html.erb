    <b>whyVOTE</b> is a social media platform for politics.
    <br>The platform provides young Canadians everything they need to know about an upcoming election and allows them to compare views with friends.

    </br> Based out of the University of Waterloo, we are a startup piloting for the 2015 Federal Election (October 19, 2015). The current beta version of our platform is accessible to any student enrolled at the University of Waterloo.</br> In addition to providing young Canadians a central platform for elections information, whyVOTE also collects data on the youth opinion to provide to policy-influencers. </br></br></br>
