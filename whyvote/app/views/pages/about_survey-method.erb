    </br>In June 2015, we polled a sample of over 200 University of Waterloo students to determine policy topics of most interest to students.</br>These include (in order of popularity):
<ol>
  <li>Electoral reform</li>
  <li>Combatting climate change</li>
  <li>Combatting terrorist threads</li>
  <li>Military spending</li>
  <li>Employment and skills training</li>
  <li>Post-secondary issues</li>
  <li>Economic stimulus</li>
  <li>Tax policy</li>
  <li>International trade</li>
</ol>
</br>We created the survey based on these 9 topics. Research was done by the whyVOTE team utilizing various media and government sources.</br></br><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> </br>Although we try our best to be non-partisan and as accurate as possible with our information, we do not guarantee all policies and issues are presented 100% accurately.</br>Thus, please do not hesitate to contact us if you see any errors or mistakes in our work.</br>
