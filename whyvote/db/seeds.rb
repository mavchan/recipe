FPTP is where the candidate with the most votes in a riding wins a seat (an absolute majority is not necessary) in the House of Commons and represents that riding as its Member of Parliament. The alternative to the FPTP system is Proportional Representation (PR), which includes a range of electoral systems. In PR, the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party or individual candidate.' })
